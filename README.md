# Lab 3: Pulses!
*Lab3_frdmmcxa153_ctimer_pwm_example*

The goal of this lab is to show how to use the SDK drivers PWM example. Once identified the
project to be used, we will make some modifications in the original file to demonstrate the
usage of the embedded MCUXpresso Config Tool and we will discover some utility functions
part of the SDK that might be useful in any application.
MCX A microcontrollers can generate PWM signals in different ways, in this lab we will only
make use of a standard timer. MCUXpresso SDK comes with a set of prebuilt projects useful
as a starting point to build applications and use the standard peripherals also known as
drivers. During this lab we will make use of the standard driver for Timer.
